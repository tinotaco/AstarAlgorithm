# A* Algorithm (in Progress)

This is a small project which implements the A* Algorithm. A detailed readme.md still needs to be written.

Currently the small project can:
    - Create a grid environment which is customizable
    - Implement core functionalities of the A* algorithm for one iteration
    - Graph the frontier, executed point, environment, and the start and end point

To be implemented/completed:
    - Implementing one function which runs the AStar Algorithm
    - Getting the shortest path from the one function
    - Partially elaborate description of the AStar Algorithm
    - Animation of the results
    - Cleanup the project
